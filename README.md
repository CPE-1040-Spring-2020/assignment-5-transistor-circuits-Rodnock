**PNP transistor circuit:**

1. It lights up when the switch is off. The transistor is getting voltage from the emitter, and sending it to the collector, bypassing the base.

**Switch off voltage:**

Across resistor: .333 mV

At Collector: 5V

At Base: 4.3V

At Emitter: 5V

**Switch off current:**

Collector: 6.4 mA

At Base: .4 mA

At Emitter: 6.8 mA

**Switch on voltage:**

Across resistor: 5V

At Collector: 0V

At Base: 5V

At Emitter: 5V

**Switch on current:**

Collector: 0uA

Base: 0uA

Emitter: 0uA
